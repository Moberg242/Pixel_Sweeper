# Ghibli Grams

## Overview
This is a web-based game of nonogram that's a cross between sudoku and minesweeper! As noted in wikipedia, this game is originally based on a design created by Non Ishida in 1987 that inspired a puzzle game to create a picture by filling out squares in a grid. Use the hints on the side of the board to create your image!

The rules are simple: Use the hints on the top and bottom of the grid to determine which squares should be filled out. Select "fill" or "blank" and then click on squares to fill out the grid! Don't make too many mistakes or you lose!
