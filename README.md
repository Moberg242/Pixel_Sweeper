# Pixel Sweeper

## Overview
This is a web-based game of nonogram that's a cross between sudoku and minesweeper! As noted in wikipedia, this game is originally based on a design created by Non Ishida in 1987 that inspired a puzzle game to create a picture by filling out squares in a grid. Use the hints on the side of the board to create your image!
